ME:
Create a database with the name support_cases_management and two tables with the names support_cases and tracking.
The fields in the support_cases table have the following fields:

id which is bigint and is the auto incrementing primary key which is automatically generated and unique,
field number text, can not be null and adds a check if it is less than or equal to 15 characters
description non-null text
status is a non-null enum with the default value Open
priority is a non-null enum with default value Medium
database_name non-null text and a check of less than or equal to 63 characters
schema_name non-null text check of less than 63 characters
query_executed non-null text,
executed_by non-null text with check less than or equal to 50,
requester non-null text with check less than or equal to 50,
Timestamps (created_at and updated_at) but take into account the time zone.

The tacking table
id to be bigint, primary key increment auto generated and unique,
support_case_id bigint is the foreign key of the support_cases(id) table,
description text not null,
affected_table text can be null and a 63 character check,
affected_column text can be null and a 63 character check,
affected_row_id BIGINT can be null,
old_value text can be null,
new_value text can be null,
updated_by textno not null and a check of 50 characters,
timestamps (created_at and updated_at) taking into account the time zone.

Executed SQL
The database with the tables support_cases and tracking has been successfully created. Here are the details:

support_cases Table
id: BIGINT, primary key, auto-incrementing
field_number: TEXT, not null, max 15 characters
description: TEXT, not null
status: TEXT, not null, enum ('Open', 'Closed', 'Pending'), default 'Open'
priority: TEXT, not null, enum ('Low', 'Medium', 'High'), default 'Medium'
database_name: TEXT, not null, max 63 characters
schema_name: TEXT, not null, max 63 characters
query_executed: TEXT, not null
executed_by: TEXT, not null, max 50 characters
requester: TEXT, not null, max 50 characters
created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ, default current timestamp
updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ, default current timestamp
tracking Table
id: BIGINT, primary key, auto-incrementing
support_case_id: BIGINT, foreign key referencing support_cases(id)
description: TEXT, not null
affected_table: TEXT, max 63 characters
affected_column: TEXT, max 63 characters
affected_row_id: BIGINT
old_value: TEXT
new_value: TEXT
updated_by: TEXT, not null, max 50 characters
created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ, default current timestamp
updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ, default current timestamp
These tables are now ready for use in managing support cases and tracking changes.

Conversation renamed to Support Cases Management Database Setup change
Looking at the scripts, I see you added the date fields as timestamptz is it the same as doing this?
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

ME:
or you didn't take into account the time zone?

IA:
Yes, using TIMESTAMPTZ is equivalent to specifying TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE. Both ensure that the timestamp values are stored with time zone information. The DEFAULT NOW() part sets the default value to the current timestamp, including the time zone. So, the time zone is indeed taken into account in the scripts provided.

ME:
The enum you left inside the script itself better leave them outside as:

type priority_level as enum('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
status_type as enum ('Open', 'In Progress', 'Closed', 'Resolved');

Error executing SQL
The error occurred because the existing default value for the priority column cannot be automatically cast to the new priority_level enum type. To resolve this, we need to remove the default value before changing the column type and then set the default value again after the type change. Let's proceed with these steps.


Error executing SQL
It seems I attempted to alter the table before creating the enum types. Let's first create the enum types and then update the table columns accordingly.


Error executing SQL
The error indicates that the conversion from text to the new enum types needs to be handled explicitly. Let's update the script to handle this conversion correctly.


Error executing SQL
It seems there is an issue with the conversion. Let's explicitly convert the existing text values to the new enum types using a more detailed approach. I'll update the script to handle this properly.


Executed SQL
create type priority_level as enum('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical');

create type status_type as enum('Open', 'In Progress', 'Closed', 'Resolved');

-- Temporarily rename the columns to avoid conflicts
alter table support_cases
rename column priority to priority_old;

alter table support_cases
rename column status to status_old;

-- Add new columns with the enum types
alter table support_cases
add column priority priority_level default 'Medium';

alter table support_cases
add column status status_type default 'Open';

-- Update the new columns with converted values
update support_cases
set
  priority = priority_old::priority_level;

update support_cases
set
  status = status_old::status_type;

-- Drop the old columns
alter table support_cases
drop column priority_old;

alter table support_cases
drop column status_old;

The enum types priority_level and status_type have been successfully created and applied to the support_cases table. The columns priority and status now use these enum types with their respective default values set.
